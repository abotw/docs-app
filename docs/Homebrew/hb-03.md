# Homebrew-03: Brewfile

## 1. What is a Brewfile?

A **Brewfile** is a plain text file used by **Homebrew Bundle** to describe **all the software you want Homebrew to install**.

You can think of it as:

>   📦 **“requirements.txt” for Homebrew**

With a Brewfile, you can:

-   Reinstall your development environment on a new Mac in one command
-   Share your setup with teammates
-   Keep your tools under version control (Git)

------

## 2. When Should You Use a Brewfile?

Use a Brewfile if you:

-   Reinstall macOS or switch to a new Mac
-   Manage multiple Macs with the same environment
-   Want reproducible dev setups
-   Are tired of re-installing tools manually

------

## 3. Installing Homebrew Bundle

Homebrew Bundle comes with Homebrew by default.

Verify it’s available:

```bash
brew bundle --version
```

If it works, you’re ready 👍

------

## 4. Basic Brewfile Structure

A Brewfile is usually named **`Brewfile`** (no extension).

Example:

```ruby
brew "git"
brew "wget"

cask "google-chrome"
cask "visual-studio-code"

tap "homebrew/cask-fonts"
cask "font-fira-code"
```

### Common directives

| Directive | Meaning                 |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| `brew`    | CLI tools               |
| `cask`    | GUI apps                |
| `tap`     | Additional repositories |
| `mas`     | Mac App Store apps      |

------

## 5. Creating a Brewfile Automatically

If you already have many packages installed, let Homebrew generate one for you:

```bash
brew bundle dump
```

This creates a `Brewfile` in the current directory.

### Include everything (recommended)

```bash
brew bundle dump --describe --force
```

-   `--describe` → adds comments
-   `--force` → overwrite existing Brewfile

------

## 6. Installing from a Brewfile

To install **everything listed** in a Brewfile:

```bash
brew bundle
```

Or explicitly specify the file:

```bash
brew bundle --file Brewfile
```

Homebrew will:

-   Install missing packages
-   Skip already installed ones

------

## 7. Brewfile Example (Realistic Setup)

```ruby
# Taps
tap "homebrew/cask"
tap "homebrew/cask-fonts"

# CLI tools
brew "git"
brew "zsh"
brew "tmux"
brew "htop"
brew "python"

# GUI applications
cask "iterm2"
cask "visual-studio-code"
cask "google-chrome"
cask "raycast"

# Fonts
cask "font-jetbrains-mono"

# Mac App Store apps
mas "Xcode", id: 497799835
```

------

## 8. Managing Mac App Store Apps (`mas`)

First install `mas`:

```bash
brew install mas
```

Find an app ID:

```bash
mas search Xcode
```

Example entry:

```ruby
mas "Xcode", id: 497799835
```

------

## 9. Common Brew Bundle Commands

| Command               | Description              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `brew bundle`         | Install everything       |
| `brew bundle dump`    | Generate Brewfile        |
| `brew bundle check`   | Check missing packages   |
| `brew bundle cleanup` | Remove unlisted packages |
| `brew bundle list`    | Show Brewfile entries    |

⚠️ `cleanup` can uninstall software — use carefully.

------

## 10. Best Practices

### ✅ Keep Brewfile in Git

```bash
git add Brewfile
git commit -m "Add Brewfile"
```

### ✅ One Brewfile per machine (optional)

```text
Brewfile
Brewfile.work
Brewfile.personal
```

Install with:

```bash
brew bundle --file Brewfile.work
```

### ✅ Comment generously

```ruby
brew "ffmpeg" # video processing
```

------

## 11. Where Should I Put the Brewfile?

Common choices:

-   `~/Brewfile`
-   `~/.config/homebrew/Brewfile`
-   Inside your dotfiles repo

Then run:

```bash
brew bundle --file ~/Brewfile
```

------

## 12. Brewfile vs Manual Install

| Manual `brew install` | Brewfile               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Easy for one tool     | Perfect for full setup |
| Hard to reproduce     | Fully reproducible     |
| No history            | Git-friendly           |

------

## 13. Typical Workflow (Recommended)

```bash
# On old Mac
brew bundle dump --force
git commit -am "Update Brewfile"

# On new Mac
brew bundle
```

Done 🎉

------

## 14. Summary

-   **Brewfile = declarative package list**
-   One command restores your Mac environment
-   Essential for developers and power users
-   Works great with Git and dotfiles
