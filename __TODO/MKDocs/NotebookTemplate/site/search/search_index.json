It has long been a day for the Chinese to show care and love to the elderly. As part of the efforts to deal with the aging population and better protect their rights and interests, China passed a new law stipulating (\u89c4\u5b9a) that family members should pay regular visits to their elderly relatives. The ruling came into force on July 1, 2013. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China had more than 200 million people aged 65 and above in 2021, accounting for 14.2 percent of the total population.</p> <p>China has had lots of achievements in elderly care services over the past 10 years, and China's social security system for the elderly has been continuously improved to ensure that senior citizens enjoy a peaceful life. By the end of 2021, over one billion people in China were covered by basic pension insurance and 1.36 billion were covered by medical insurance. Solid progress has been made in building a social and health care service system for the elderly. By the first quarter of 2022, around 360,000 elderly care institutions and facilities had been established across the country. According to a study by China Foundation for Seniors, by 2030, China's elderly population will reach 400 million, and the size of the elderly care service market will reach 12 trillion yuan.</p>"},{"location":"201/Listening/2025-06-13/#questions-1-to-3-are-based-on-the-news-report-you-have-just-heard","title":"Questions 1 to 3 are based on the news report you have just heard.","text":"<ol> <li>What is the news report mainly about?</li> <li>What is the purpose of China\u2019s Double Ninth Festival?</li> <li>How many elderly care institutions and facilities had been established by the first quarter of 2022?</li> </ol>"},{"location":"201/Listening/2025-06-13/#main-idea","title":"Main idea","text":"<p>The passage introduces the Double Ninth Festival and highlights China's growing elderly population, along with the government\u2019s efforts and achievements in improving elderly care services and social security.</p>"},{"location":"201/Listening/2025-06-13/#collocations-expressions","title":"Collocations &amp;

Mrs. Brown, thank you for joining us. Tonight we have a special program dedicated to (about) paternal leave.</p> <p>W: Good evening. Thank you for having (inviting) me.</p> <p>M:So Mrs. Brown, would you please share something with us about paternal leave in Sweden?</p> <p>W:Of course. Paternal leave gives the father a chance to take time off work to care for his baby and do shopping for the family.</p> <p>M:How long can fathers stay off from work and do they still get paid?</p> <p>W:Actually, Sweden has long had generous parental leave. A couple can take up to 13 months off work between them with the employer paying 80% of lost wages up to 3,425 dollars a month. A further 90 days can be taken for a nominal (\u8c61\u5f81\u6027\u7684) sum. The leave can be used all at once or in batches (\u5206\u6279) before the child is 8. It is notionally divided 50/50. It can be transferred between the parents.</p> <p>M:Are fathers willing to take paternal leave?</p> <p>W:Many are reluctant to use their paternal leave. Mothers take as much as 85% of all the parental leave. This frustrates feminists (\u5973\u6743\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005) who believe that shared responsibility for childcare is a key to equality in the labor market. Sweden has one of the world's highest rates of female participation in the labor force, but women's wages still lag behind men's.</p> <p>M:How does the government look at this?</p> <p>W:The government sympathizes. It is impressed by evidence that fathers who take more responsibility for small children are more likely to stay in contact. A committee is looking into ways to increase father\u2019s take-up of parental leave.</p>"},{"location":"201/Listening/2025-06-13/#questions-4-to-7-are-based-on-the-conversation-you-have-just-heard","title":"Questions 4 to 7 are based on the conversation you have just

Most people, and many animals, like eating it. However, for some, in Africa, the only way to get honey is to find a wild bees\u2019 nest and take the honey from it. Often, these nests are high up in trees, and it is difficult to find them. In parts of Africa, though, people looking for honey have a strange and unexpected helper\u2014a little bird called a honeyguide.</p> <p>The honeyguide does not actually like honey, but it does like the wax in the beehives. The little bird cannot reach this wax, which is deep inside the bees\u2019 nest. So, when it finds a suitable nest, it looks for someone to help it. The honeyguide gives a loud cry that attracts the attention of both passing animals and people.

She was taught to speak only when she was spoken to, and when she went out on her own, she was reminded to say \"please\" and \"thank you\". Children in her day, she continues, were expected to be seen and not heard, but these days you are lucky if you ever hear parents telling their children to mind their p's and q's. If you give her the chance she then takes out of her desk the old photograph album which she keeps there, and which she never tires of displaying. Of course when you look at pictures of her parents you feel sure that, with a father as hard-looking as that, you, too, would have been \"seen and not heard\". Beside him sits his wife, with their children around her: Granny and her elder brothers. It always occurs to me that perhaps those long, stiff, black clothes were very heavy to a little girl, that she hadn't enough breath left to talk, let alone bad. It must have been a dull and lonely life too, for she stayed mainly at home during her childhood, while her brothers were sent away to school from an early age. That said, my childhood was much freer than Granny's. I went to school with my brother, and I played football with him and his friends.

My generation certainly grew up hearing and believing in this statement, which doesn't stop most of us from rushing out in the morning with only a cup of coffee and a piece of toast. However, in an estimated 40 percent of American families there isn't even an adult present in the kitchen to urge children to finish their breakfast. So, more children avoid breakfast than any other meal. While no one has proven that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, it's at least of equal importance with lunch and dinner. Experts warn that your body burns the energy from food within four hours. Although you may use up less energy while you sleep, it's a long time until morning and you still wake up with the need for lots more fuel. Some studies have shown that children who avoid breakfast don't do as well in school. Besides lack of energy, we all know how tough it is to focus when your stomach's making noises and you're counting hours until lunch. In addition, a recent Canadian study suggests that avoiding breakfast may increase the chance of a heart attack. It's been known that the incidence of heart attacks is highest in the first few hours after waking. So, there's no doubt the importance of breakfast is more than just an old wives' tale. The problem comes in following the advice. How do you find time to make a proper meal and then make time to eat it? The American Health Association recommends that breakfast should supply at least one-fourth of the daily food needs. And it's important to include a variety of foods to supply energy until the next meal.

Our 100,000 students are currently studying at the Open University. We found limited development of distance learning in the case studies, with the exception of some postgraduate and professional courses. Even here, however, there seemed to be limits on further growth because of the high costs involved in setting up new distance learning courses, as well as uncertainties of demand (particularly in terms of the perceived financial returns on study). One of the case study universities provided video facilities and visiting staff to a rural area for a group of undergraduate students about 50 miles away. This was a new development which was working well and likely to be expanded to involve other universities. The main reason for general lack of development of distance learning, especially at the undergraduate level, may be that other universities have been unable to afford the considerable set-up costs and student support facilities. As costs of technology come down this might change. The Open Learning Foundation is developing connections between universities to set open learning approaches within existing programs of study and thus encourage their greater use.

The world needs creators, makers and shakers of the new centuries, not the followers of the past centuries. As the numbers increase at college and university level, more students from the lower ends are likely to be thrown into a process designed to choose only learners that have proved excellent in listening to teachers.</p> <p>There are three ways to learn: looking, listening and doing.</p> <p>Students and teachers today are a product of learning by listening. The computer may not be liked by traditional teachers, who use Rote-learning to put information, which will be out of date in a few years, into the heads of the students. With computer learning you learn by looking, listening and doing; you use three methods of learning, not just one. Therefore, you can learn faster.</p> <p>The changing speed of information is frightening. What we learn now will be out of date in the near future. So what students are learning now at school may be replaced by the time they finish university. We have to learn by choice what to forget.

One day, however, he was disappointed to find the book missing from its usual place. He was about to leave, when he noticed the owner of the shop making a gesture to him with his hand. Expecting to be scolded, he went towards him. To his surprise, the owner pointed to the book which was put away in a corner. \"I put it there in case anyone had a desire to buy it!\" he said, and left the delighted student to continue his reading.</p>"},{"location":"201/Reading/2025-06-16/#questions-1620_1","title":"\u2753Questions 16\u201320","text":"<ol> <li>Time spent in a bookshop can be most pleasant <code>_______________</code>.<ul> <li>A. only when you can find the book you want to buy</li> <li>B. only when you are a book-lover</li> <li>C. even when you enter it to avoid a sudden shower</li> <li>D. even when you know you are late for an appointment</li> </ul> </li> <li>A bookshop is of much attraction because <code>______________</code>.<ul> <li>A. it offers you an opportunity to forget about everyday life</li> <li>B. it offers you an opportunity to listen to as much music as possible</li> <li>C. it allows you to learn about new ideas and ways of doing things</li> <li>D. it allows you to have a good excuse for being late for an appointment</li> </ul> </li> <li>In a good bookshop <code>__________</code>.<ul> <li>A. an assistant should always follow you</li> <li>B. an assistant should frequently approach you and offer help</li> <li>C. you needn't buy anything you don't want</li> <li>D. you can communicate freely with an assistant</li> </ul> </li> <li>The medical student went to a bookshop every day <code>_____________</code>.<ul> <li>A. to look for useful books</li> <li>B. to read a textbook</li> <li>C. to talk with the shop owner</li> <li>D. to use the computer at the shop</li> </ul> </li> <li>The owner of the bookshop put away the book <code>______________</code>.<ul> <li>A. in case other people wanted to buy it</li> <li>B. in case the medical student wanted to buy it</li> <li>C. because he wanted to sell it at a high price</li> <li>D. because he wanted to keep it for himself</li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"201/Reading/2025-06-16/#summary_3","title":"\ud83d\udd22 Summary","text":"<p>This passage celebrates the serene and immersive experience of spending time in a bookshop, highlighting its unique ability to offer an escape from daily life and a welcoming environment for Browse without pressure to purchase, exemplified by the compassionate gesture of a shop owner towards a struggling student.</p>"},{"location":"201/Reading/2025-06-16/#answers-and-explanation_8","title":"\u2705 Answers and Explanation","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Time spent in a bookshop can be most pleasant <code>_______________</code>.</p> <ul> <li>A. only when you can find the book you want to buy</li> <li>B. only when you are a book-lover</li> <li>C. even when you enter it to avoid a sudden shower</li> <li>D. even when you know you are late for an appointment</li> </ul> <p>\u89e3\u6790\uff1a \u6587\u7ae0\u5f00\u5934\u5c31\u8bf4\uff1a\u201cTime spent in a bookshop can be most pleasant, whether you are a book-lover or merely there to buy a book as a present.

If you telephone him early in the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call shows that the matter is very important and requires immediate attention. The same meaning is attached to telephone calls made after 11:00 p. m. If someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he assumes it's a matter of life and death. The time chosen for the call communicates its importance.</p> <p>In social life, time plays a very important role. In the US guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. But this is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten.</p> <p>The meaning of time is different in different parts of the world. Thus, misunderstandings arise between people from cultures that treat time differently. To be on time is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not on time, they may be regarded as not polite or not fully responsible. In the US no one would think of keeping a business associate waiting for an hour; it would be bad-mannered. A person who is five minutes late is expected to apologize. If he is less than five minutes late, he will say a few words of explanation, though perhaps he will not complete the sentence.</p>"},{"location":"201/Reading/2025-06-16/#questions-2125_1","title":"\u2753Questions 21\u201325","text":"<ol> <li>If you telephone someone early in the day, it means <code>___________________.</code><ul> <li>A. you are expected to explain why</li> <li>B. you are not kind enough</li> <li>C. you want to show your concern for him</li> <li>D. you have a very important matter to discuss</li> </ul> </li> <li>The expression \"a matter of life and death\" means <code>__________________</code>.<ul> <li>A. an issue of the greatest importance and emergency</li> <li>B. a very important appointment</li> <li>C. a matter of whether someone should live or die</li> <li>D. a strong desire to communicate</li> </ul> </li> <li>In the US guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded <code>_______________</code>.<ul> <li>A. if the invitation to a dinner party is not extended early enough</li> <li>B. if the invitation to a dinner party is extended too far in advance</li> <li>C. if the invitation to a dinner party is not extended repeatedly</li> <li>D. if the invitation to a dinner party is extended to too many people</li> </ul> </li> <li>The word \"misunderstanding\" can be explained as <code>____________</code>.<ul> <li>A. failing to attend a party</li> <li>B. failing to understand correctly</li> <li>C. standing in one's way</li> <li>D. standing on one's own feet</li> </ul> </li> <li>Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?<ul> <li>A.

of states Typically fewer states needed May require more states Design complexity Slightly more complex because output logic depends on both state and input Simpler to design because output depends

Whenever she gets the opportunity, she describes in detail how she used to be told to respect her elders and betters. She was taught to speak only when she was spoken to, and when she went out on her own, she was reminded to say \"please\" and \"thank you\". Children in her day, she continues, were expected to be seen and not heard, but these days you are lucky if you ever hear parents telling their children to mind their p's and q's.</p> <p>If you give her the chance she then takes out of her desk the old photograph album which she keeps there, and which she never tires of displaying. Of course when you look at pictures of her parents you feel sure that, with a father as hard-looking as that, you, too, would have been \"seen and not heard\". Beside him sits his wife, with their children around her: Granny and her elder brothers. It always occurs to me that perhaps those long, stiff, black clothes were very heavy to a little girl, that she hadn't enough breath left to talk, let alone bad. It must have been a dull and lonely life too, for she stayed mainly at home during her childhood, while her brothers were sent away to school from an early age.</p> <p>That said, my childhood was much freer than Granny's. I went to school with my brother, and I played football with him and his friends. We all spoke a common language and we got up to the same trouble. I would have died if I had had to stay indoors, wear a tight frock (\u5973\u5f0f\u793c\u670d), and sew.</p> <p>1. How can we understand \"children in her day were expected to be seen and not heard\"?</p> <p>A. Children were not supposed to be heard by others.</p> <p>B. Children were not supposed to hear their parents' conversation.</p> <p>C. Children were not supposed to speak in the face of others.</p> <p>D. Children were not supposed to speak until asked to do it.</p> <p>2. What is the expression of \"mind their p's and q's\" supposed to mean?</p> <p>A. To mind their own business.</p> <p>B. To remember to say \"please\".</p> <p>C. To remember to say \"thank you\".</p> <p>D. To be well-mannered.</p> <p>3. Which of the following words can be used to describe Granny's feelings of her own childhood?</p> <p>A. Lonely.</p> <p>B. Dull.</p> <p>C. Proud.</p> <p>D. Happy.</p> <p>4. How did the author feel about her Granny's childhood?</p> <p>A. Disappointed.</p> <p>B. Unbearable.</p> <p>C. Respectable.</p> <p>D. Indifferent.</p> <p>5. Why did Granny often complain about modern children's behavior?</p> <p>A. She missed those good old days.</p> <p>B. She was too harsh on children.</p> <p>C.

My generation certainly grew up hearing and believing in this statement, which doesn't stop most of us from rushing out in the morning with only a cup of coffee and a piece of toast. However, in an estimated 40 percent of American families there isn't even an adult present in the kitchen to urge children to finish their breakfast. So, more children avoid breakfast than any other meal.</p> <p>While no one has proven that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, it's at least of equal importance with lunch and dinner. Experts warn that your body burns the energy from food within four hours. Although you may use up less energy while you sleep, it's a long time until morning and you still wake up with the need for lots more fuel.</p> <p>Some studies have shown that children who avoid breakfast don't do as well in school. Besides lack of energy, we all know how tough it is to focus when your stomach's making noises and you're counting hours until lunch.</p> <p>In addition, a recent Canadian study suggests that avoiding breakfast may increase the chance of a heart attack. It's been known that the incidence of heart attacks is highest in the first few hours after waking.</p> <p>So, there's no doubt the importance of breakfast is more than just an old wives' tale. The problem comes in following the advice. How do you find time to make a proper meal and then make time to eat it?</p> <p>The American Health Association recommends that breakfast should supply at least one-fourth of the daily food needs. And it's important to include a variety of foods to supply energy until the next meal. Foods like bread can be digested (\u6d88\u5316) in as little as 30 minutes; however, foods like eggs, milk, meat, and cheese last longer, and can help you make it to lunchtime.</p> <p>6.

Our 100,000 students are currently studying at the Open University. We found limited development of distance learning in the case studies, with the exception of some postgraduate and professional courses. Even here, however, there seemed to be limits on further growth because of the high costs involved in setting up new distance learning courses, as well as uncertainties of demand (particularly in terms of the perceived financial returns on study). One of the case study universities provided video facilities and visiting staff to a rural area for a group of undergraduate students about 50 miles away. This was a new development which was working well and likely to be expanded to involve other universities.</p> <p>The main reason for general lack of development of distance learning, especially at the undergraduate level, may be that other universities have been unable to afford the considerable set-up costs and student support facilities. As costs of technology come down this might change. The Open Learning Foundation is developing connections between universities to set open learning approaches within existing programs of study and thus encourage their greater use. This is seen as likely to develop further in the future.</p> <p>21.

This 40-volume set will be the largest printed in its 231-year history.</p> <p>Because of the success of recent Internet and computer encyclopedias, some people have suggested that the publishers could turn their back on print.

And none are used more than those published by the Encyclopedia Britannica.</p> <p>Even so, the company is selling fewer and fewer books and more and more computer encyclopedias, possibly because of the price.

Dr. Home, a sleep researcher in England, studied 24 college students. One group got their normal eight hours of sleep. The other group didn't get any sleep at all---they stayed awake all night. The next day, Dr. Home tested the students. He asked them questions that required creative and original thinking. One of the questions was \"How many uses can a box be put to?\"</p> <p>The results? The wide-awake students did well on the tests. The tired students did poorly.</p> <p>Research has already shown that tired people can do okay on tests of routine thinking, like simple addition. But Dr. Home tested creative thinking only.</p> <p>As part of his study, he offered an amount of money as a reward to the tired students if they did well. But even this encouragement wasn't enough to help the students overcome their tiredness. They still did poorly. Dr. Home believes that the part of the brain where thinking takes place may get worn out during waking hours. Sleep may help to repair the brain overnight. Without any sleep, he emphasizes, \"even if you think harder, you cannot do better.\"</p> <p>This study gives people something to think about, especially people like hospital workers and airplane pilots, who must stay awake all night and then make emergency decisions.</p> <p>6.
